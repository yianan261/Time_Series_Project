# Time_Series_Project
Predicting energy consumption usage with machine learning models

---
## Introduction:
This project uses machine learning models to predict hourly energy consumption patterns using data from the PJM regional transmission organization.
Our models allow us to make future forecast based on historical data for any future business or resource-allocation planning needs. Specifically, the Random Forest Model, XGBoost Model, RNN and LSTM Models are trained on the dataset and evaluated.

## Dataset:
[PJM Hourly Energy Consumption Data from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robikscube/hourly-energy-consumption)

## Code:
All implementations including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation can be found in ML_Project_Time_Series_final(1).ipynb

## Paper:
Our final report of this project can be found in the Energy_Consumption_Prediction_Report.pdf
